              <h2>Info</h2>
              <p>Hi! My name is Lucas Miguel Y. Sacramento, and I play games. I play a lot of games, ranging from fps such as Valorant and CSGO, to sandbox such as
                Terraria and Minecraft. I've been an avid gamer my whole life, starting from when I was around 4. I tried out Valorant about a year ago and
                I've gotten hooked ever since. I love gaming, and I've met so many friends and new people through this extremely fun hobby of mine.
                It isn't really given much praise, even if you're incredibly skilled at what you do, which is mainly from a bad stigma of computer games.
              </p>

              <h2>Valorant Career</h2>
              <p>As Valorant is one of my interests, this site is dedicated to that! I really enjoy the game and viewing its esports scene.
                I'm around gold in ranking, which is around the middle of the Valorant ranking system. I always try to improve and better myself
                so I can see my rank rise. You can usually see me playing Chamber, Astra, Raze, Reyna, Skye, and Sova. If anyone sees this, feel free 
                to add me, lustreVAL#garb on Valorant. Thank you!
