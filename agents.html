          <h2>Duelists</h2>
          <p>Flashy, selfish, and yet a good or bad one can make or break your game. Duelists are the key entry players that take space and control for your team.
            Most of their abilities and utility are to get them into a specific site, and hold it. Jett, Neon, Phoenix, Yoru, and Raze are the current duelists.
            Meanwhile on defense, duelists will usually play a more passive role and help out wherever they can. Or just push and do the opposite of defense.
          </p>

            <h2>Controllers</h2>
            <p>Arguably the most important role of the squad, controllers cut up site using smokes and walls to give your team an edge. This type of agent
                usually needs a lot of skill, smart ability usage, and well-versed map knowledge. Astra, Viper, Brimstone, Omen, and Harbor (not pictured) 
                are the current controllers in the game.
            </p>

            <h2>Sentinels</h2>
            <p>The most important member of the team on the defensive half, sentinels lock down a site and prevent attackers' entry. Their utility is all about 
                delaying. Delay long enough for your team to arrive, or make the opponents expend all of their abilities. Chamber, Killjoy, Cypher, and Sage are 
                the sentinels currently in game.
            </p>

          <div class="agentscontent" style="border: solid rgb(0, 0, 0)">
            <h2>Initiators</h2>
            <p>Usually a supportive role, initiators can vary on their uses. For example, agents such as Skye or Kay/o are great at gathering information and having 
                good flash utlity. On the other side, Sova and Fade are all about gaining information on enemy positions to give you a read on the enemy team. 
                Breach is amazing at delaying, creating team plays, and general support.
