          <h2>What is Valorant?</h2>
          <p>Valorant is a 5v5 tactical shooter, created by Riot Games. It features unique agents, each with different abilities for each situation. 
            These agents are separated into 4 roles, Duelists, Initiators, Sentinels, and Controllers. 
            You can explore the Agents tab to learn more. 
            It also features the most precise gunplay, along with 17 different guns to choose from. 
            Each one is suited to its own situations, and its own strengths and weaknesses.
            Lastly, it also has 7 different maps with different layouts, all set in beautiful places of the world.</p>

          <h2>Mechanics and Objectives.</h2>
          <p>On a predetermined map, you and your team must choose 5 agents to play. 
            As a group, you must make tactical decisions on which agents play which map best.
            The objective is to win 13 rounds. There are a total of 24 rounds, separated into two halves.
            There are two sides, attackers and defenders, each with a different win condition.
            You can win rounds by detonating the spike, defusing the spike, or eliminating the entire enemy team.</p>
