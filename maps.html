        <div class="mapscontent" style="border: solid rgb(0, 0, 0)">
          <h2>Bind</h2>
          <p> An old KINGDOM processing plant, Bind is set along the sandy towns of Northern Africa. 
            The map is divided into two sites, along with it's unique feature, teleporters that can take you from one side to the other.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="mapscontent" style="border: solid rgb(0, 0, 0)">
            <h2>Haven</h2>
            <p> Set in the old ruins of a monastery in Bhutan, Haven has some stunning scenery, featuring hexagonal basalt pillars.
                Its unique map design features three sites, instead of the normal two sites per map.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="mapscontent" style="border: solid rgb(0, 0, 0)">
            <h2>Ascent</h2>
            <p> Ascent is set on top of a flying chunk of land, pulled straight from Venice, caused by a spike explosion. As per usual, it has two sites. 
                It features beautiful, though destroyed, Italian architecture and has switch-operated breakable doors as its unique mechanic.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="mapscontent" style="border: solid rgb(0, 0, 0)">
            <h2>Breeze</h2>
            <p> In the Bermuda Triangle there lies an island. And on that island is where Breeze is located. 
                Beautiful beaches, cool tropical themes, and mysterious structures that indicate past human interference, Breeze also features
                an unbreakable mechanical door, a one-way vent, and some rope ziplines for easy mobility. 
                It features two sites with only one entry point per site.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="mapscontent" style="border: solid rgb(0, 0, 0)">
            <h2>Fracture</h2>
            <p> A research facility built along the dense forests and sandy canyons set in New Mexico, USA, Fracture has a large collider in the middle.
                Also in the middle, cutting up the map, are two long ziplines that take you to one side or the other.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="mapscontent" style="border: solid rgb(0, 0, 0)">
            <h2>Icebox</h2>
            <p> Built in the icy harbors and mountains of Siberia, Icebox is a research facility and container port.
                It features ropes and ziplines and the map is famously known for its verticality.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="mapscontent" style="border: solid rgb(0, 0, 0)">
            <h2>Split</h2>
            <p> In the Shinjuku district of Tokyo, Split is split (see what I did there) 
                between an older part of the district and a newer commercial area run by KINGDOM.
                It features two main sites, connected by a zipline accessible vent in the middle of the map.
                Currently out of map rotation.</p>
