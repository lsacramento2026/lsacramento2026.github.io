          <h2>Pistols</h2>
          <p>Everyone's starting weapon, or weapon of choice for rounds where you can't afford better guns. There are 5 pistols in total.
            The Classic, Shorty, Frenzy, Ghost, and Sheriff. The Classic is the gun everyone spawns with, and can fire 3 shots at once with a right click.
            The shorty is a double-barreled short range shotgun, best used for holding corners. 
            The frenzy is a 13-round automatic pistol, best for running and shooting to catch enemy agents off guard.
            The ghost is a 15-round silenced pistol, good for one-taps, and masking your shot sounds.
            The sheriff is a 6-round revolver, with the capacity to one-hit even an enemy at full armor. Choose the best one per situation.

            <h2>Shotguns/SMGs</h2>
            <p>Most likely the second weapons you're going to use, SMGs and shotguns can have a wide variety of uses. 
                Both weapon classes have 2 each, and have great mobility while using them.
                The stinger is a 20-round auto SMG, but can be bursted with a right click. 
                The spectre is a silenced SMG, good for mid to short range encounters.
                The bucky is a 5-shell pump action shotgun, good for holding corners and retreating, due to it's lengthy animations.
                The judge is a 7-round full auto shotgun which has a wide spread, low damage, and is best used in extremely close fights.

            <h2>Assault Rifles</h2>
            <p>The standard loadout you're gonna have in a round, these rifles are great for mid to long range combat. There are 4 rifles.
                The bulldog is a burst/auto rifle, and has good damage at all ranges, making it a good all-around rifle.
                The guardian is a 12-round semi automatic rifle, and has a high zoom optic, making it great for longer ranges than usual rifles.
                The phantom is a silenced auto rifle, good for spraying close range or burst-firing for accuracy at mid range.
                The vandal is a full automatic rifle, with a slow firerate, making it more geared for tap-firing and bursting.

            <h2>Snipers</h2>
            <p>With 2 snipers currently in the game, they are geared for very long range combat and holding down an angle.
                Designed to punish attackers or defenders who peek too far.
                The marshal is a 5-round lever action rifle with a decent fire-rate, a scope, and almost 100% accurate hip-fire.
                The operator is a slow, heavy bolt action rifle that can kill with only one shot to the torso. Favored by Jett and Chamber players.

                The odin is a 100-round machingun that is capable of long sustained fire that's accurate if you crouch.
